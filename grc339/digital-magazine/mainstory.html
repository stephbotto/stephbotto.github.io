        <h2>Motivation vs. Discipline</h2>
        <p>
          What’s the main driving factor in a successful fitness journey? If you think motivation is the key, then you need to keep reading. Unfortunately we're just not programmed to feel motivated all the time - so why do we create that expectation for ourselves, and also assume that the achievements of 'successful people' are a result of their level of motivation?
        </p>
        <p>
          Truly successful people don’t act on impulse or emotion. They rely on consistent action, awareness and accountability to reach their goals and make things happen. Initially you need a bit of motivation to get the ball rolling and take action, and typically all goes well and smooth at first. However the issue happens when you hit your first speed bump or an uphill slope, and the motivation ball stops rolling.This is where discipline comes into the picture. 
        </p>
        <p>
         Let's break down discipline  Broadly speaking, discipline is what you use to get the things that you don't enjoy done, whereas motivation is more of a helper.Both have their own roles in your health and fitness journey, but it’s vital to not rely solely on one or the other. We spoke with Mindset Coach and Neuroscientist Alexis Fernandez, to break down discipline, and share her best advice to help you stay consistent, focused, and disciplined in your health and fitness journey and beyond. Alexis says that "Most of the reasons we don’t get something done, has got nothing to do with our physical ability, our mental ability or the time we have at our disposal. It's often due to a lack of discipline and lack of consistency.The thing that separates those who get what they want and those who don’t isn’t anything exciting, actually it is the opposite. It's the ability to stay disciplined when it's no longer fun, and the ability to stay consistent every day when you're doing the ‘mundane’ tasks. That is what separates the ones who achieve vs. the ones who only dream of it".

        <p>It's all about making tweaks in your daily habits, and implementing changes bit by bit that will compound over time.Alexis recognises that the process is what's most important, not just focusing on the outcome."You need to prioritise what aspects of your days are going to be consistent, so you can free up other parts of your day for the things you enjoy and keeping a sense of balance. Instead of starting the day scrolling on your phone, get up and move for 30 minutes before you convince yourself not to. The more consistent you are on the daily, the easier it gets. Once it becomes part of your habitual way of being it will feel weird not to do it. That’s the sweet spot.You don’t have to love every aspect of it, but it has to feel like part of your ritual, and still makes you feel good after you do it. Beware that the journey won't always be fun or exciting, and may even take a little bit longer than you hoped. But don’t overestimate what you can achieve in two weeks, play the long game and think of what you can achieve in one year of staying consistent.

         Time will pass anyway so there is no point giving up on something because the results are taking longer than you like. Doing that is only undervaluing yourself and your capabilities". Today, you can start by determining what are the non-negotiables in your life. These are the actions that are important to you and align with your goals.Once you get clear on these, you need to make them a priority for your time and do them consistently until it becomes a part of your lifestyle without a conscious thought.Remember, you won't wake up motivated each and every day, so you have to learn to be disciplined. No one else will do it for you.If you're ready to increase your confidence and get focused on your goals, our Programs offer the perfect opportunity to realign your priorities and put yourself first.

          If you’re feeling sluggish or tired, motivation is an amazing, energizing source to help power you through that next workout or healthy meal. Motivation comes in many forms, including: Your favorite pump-up song, A YouTube hype video, A hefty dose of caffeine or pre workout, A friend or family member, An especially impressive guy or gal at your local gym. The fatal flaw with motivation is that it’s TEMPORARY. The thought passess, the song ends, and you’re right back where you started, with little drive and a lot of Netflix and tacos calling your name.
        </p>

        When a lack of motivation leaves you high and dry, we must rely on discipline to stay committed to our health and fitness goals. In our story of Uncle John and his text, here’s the difference between motivation and discipline: 
        </p>
        <p>
        Motivation - I receive a text from my 60 year old uncle telling me that he’s stronger than me (and it’s not even close). I crank up the music, add 10 more lbs to each dumbbell, and go to work! After the workout is over, the feeling fades. great, explosive fuel in the moment, but discipline is the slow-burning energy source that powers long term health and fitness success.  
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
      Discipline - Uncle John works out 4 days per week, every week, for over 45 years. Rain or shine, whether he feels like it or not, no question about it - he’s going to get it done. Over and over, for the rest of his life. Discipline will always trump motivation because it’s always there for you. Motivation is great, explosive fuel in the moment, but discipline is the slow-burning energy source that powers long term health and fitness success.  
        </p>
        <p>It could even be yourself! Reflecting on your source of motivation will allow you to understand why you’re committing to healthy habits but also help you to cultivate the discipline to stay the course long term. If you’re motivated by a specific friend or family member, you might even want to text or call them and let them know (or write an article about them on your fitness website). 
        </p>
        <p>
      Motivation is defined as the reason of an individual, to do something that will help them achieve a certain goal.And it’s very simple – If you don’t have the motivation, you won’t have the energy to do the things you have to do.Motivation is generally divided into two subtypes – External + Internal motivation.Ever tried to get in shape just to impress your ex…? This is external motivation – When you are doing certain things for something OUTSIDE of yourself.Then oppositely, you have internal motivation, which is the realization that what you’re doing is ultimately better for your OWN greater good.External motivation is usually less sustainable because it is less controllable.This is exactly why you have to rely on internal motivational factors, which will give you things no one could ever take away from you.
        </p>
        <p>
  Motivation can be both amazing for you and on the flipside, something that can actually ruin your long-term progress.The feeling of a motivation spike that keeps tight hold of you is like nothing else, but the truth is that it is not eternal, just like everything else in this life.For that exact reason, solely relying on motivation means you are doomed eventually. When it comes to working on your health, wellbeing and physical development, motivation should not exist.Discipline should.
