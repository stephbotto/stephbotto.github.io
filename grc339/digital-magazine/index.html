            <h3>motivation vs. discipline</h3>
            <p>
              What’s the main driving factor in a successful fitness journey? If you think motivation is the key, then you need to keep reading. Unfortunately we're just not programmed to feel motivated all the time - so why do we create that expectation for ourselves, and also assume that the achievements of 'successful people' are a result of their level of motivation?

            <h3>How To Incorporate a Deload Week</h3>
            <p>Whether you’ve been going back-to-back with MOXIE Programs or you're close to wrapping up our 6-Week EVOLVE Challenge, you may notice you’re starting to feel a little fatigued, that your energy levels are a little lower than what they were at the start of your Program and/or Challenge and that you’re struggling to find the motivation to push yourself during your workouts.

              <h3>How to Avoid Workout Burnout</h3>
              <p>
              Sometimes less is actually more. When you're out of balance and overdo it, too much of a good thing can turn into a not-so-great thing, and exercise is no exception to this. You're probably familiar with motivational messages like 'no pain no gain', 'go hard or go home', and 'just do it', often plastered on gym walls and thrown around in fitness circles, all in good intention...

              <h3>Level Up Your Strength Training</h3>
              <p>
              Throughout the first training block (weeks 1-2) of the Full Body Strength workouts, the primary training method used is called Wave Loading.Wave Loading helps to develop strength through a progressive rep and intensity scheme by using two ‘waves’ of sets, with the second wave using heavier weights than the first.⁣

                There's so many benefits to building muscle, but it doesn't come easy.

            <h3>Benefits of Kickboxing</h3>
            <p>
              Kickboxing is one of the best all-around workouts available, and it’s growing increasingly popular these days. Just scrolling through your favorite celeb social feeds and you'll see some Hollywood stars including Jason Statham, Nick Jonas, and Idris Elba (who is 1-0 professionally), a plethora of Victoria’s Secret supermodels, and the boxing queen herself, Adriana Lima, who all swear by its benefits.

            <h3>Why You shouldn't Skip Your Warmup</h3>
            <p>
             When we start exercising, muscle temperature rapidly increases within the first couple of minutes and reaches a plateau after 10-20 minutes. If we skip the warm-up, the abrupt motion might cause muscle pulls, impair the remaining workout session, and even cause muscle soreness after the session is completed.

            <h3>Is Stress Affecting Your Progress?</h3>
            <p>
           Exercising after a long day can be a great way to blow off steam and clear your head. But starting a high-intensity workout when you’re feeling super stressed can actually undermine your efforts. A study in the Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology found that mental fatigue negatively affects physical performance. Because your cognition and muscles are both controlled by your anterior cingulate cortex, when your brain is already tired before you start exercising, there’s a good chance your muscles may be too.
