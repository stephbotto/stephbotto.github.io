Unfortunately we're just not programmed to feel motivated all the time - so why do we create that expectation for ourselves, and also assume that the achievements of 'successful people' are a result of their level of motivation?

                                <p class="story">Typically, a deload phase will range from 1-2 weeks and is incorporated into strength training programs every 2-4 weeks to assist in recovery. We’re not saying you have to give up your training entirely during your deload week, but we’re strongly encouraging you to reduce the intensity, volume and frequency to allow your body to rest.

                                 Throughout the first training block (weeks 1-2) of the Full Body Strength workouts, the primary training method used is called Wave Loading.Wave Loading helps to develop strength through a progressive rep and intensity scheme by using two ‘waves’ of sets, with the second wave using heavier weights than the first.⁣

                                Kickboxing is one of the best all-around workouts available, and it’s growing increasingly popular these days. Just scrolling through your favorite celeb social feeds and you'll see some Hollywood stars including Jason Statham, Nick Jonas, and Idris Elba (who is 1-0 professionally), a plethora of Victoria’s Secret supermodels, and the boxing queen herself, Adriana Lima, who all swear by its benefits.

                                <p>When we start exercising, muscle temperature rapidly increases within the first couple of minutes and reaches a plateau after 10-20 minutes. If we skip the warm-up, the abrupt motion might cause muscle pulls, impair the remaining workout session, and even cause muscle soreness after the session is completed.

                                  Exercising after a long day can be a great way to blow off steam and clear your head. But starting a high-intensity workout when you’re feeling super stressed can actually undermine your efforts. A study in the Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology found that mental fatigue negatively affects physical performance.
